<p>Wow, such a presumptuous title! What was I thinking? Can I deliver a talk on how to write the <em>perfect</em> program?</p>
<p>Of course not. This is not even a technical talk in these sense that it’ll contain code! I’ll talk about a bunch of cool projects, but what I want to get at is: How can we make more of those?</p>
<p>Why? We are still trying to figure out how to write great Rust code. There are some big ambitious projects in it that work; but there is no 5 Steps guide to making one of those.</p>

<p>Some people I know have this tendency to try to work through problem all on their own. They sit down, think real hard, and come up with a solution.

<h1>For example:<br/>The borrow checker</h1>
<p>Problem: Write memory-safe high-performance code</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I’ll talk about some projects, as well as some people, and their stories. The first one is about the borrow checker. Or, the Ownership and Borrowing system that is arguably the main features that differentiates Rust from other mainstream languages.</p>
<p>The problem was writing memory-safe high-performance code. C/C++ allow writing high-performance code but getting it right is very hard.</p>
<p>Rust is a try at making a language that allowed both: High performance, and memory safety.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>I specifically said “mainstream languages”: Because there are other languages that tried that before!</p>
<p>At AT&amp;T Labs, the Cyclone language was developed as a “safe C” dialect. If you look at its features you’ll see a bunch of similarities with Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>pointer types that are guaranteed to be not-NULL</li>
<li>pointers must be initialized before they can be used</li>
<li>only safe casts</li>
</ul>
<p>Another language is ATS (Applied Type System). It’s inspired by ML, and its main feature is the built-in theorem prover. Using this, it can, at compile-time, prove the absence of buffer overflows and memory corruptions, but also other properties like division by zero.</p>

<p>And this is where Rust made the break-through: It is based on the same, old concept of affine logic, but packages it up in a practical and attractive way.</p>
<p>That Rust makes this (somewhat) approachable is probably why we are here, at a Rust conference.</p>

<p>Just adapting affine logic is not enough, we need to make it actually usable. The first iteration was good, but had known cases it didn’t support.</p>
<p>This is where new research is being done. Non-lexical lifetimes refined what the scope of an owned resource is.</p>
<p>But this is not the end, either. Borrowing/mutating parts of structs can still be made smoother. See Niko’s thoughts on <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/11/01/after-nll-interprocedural-conflicts/">After NLL</a>.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>To allow nice async I/O, green threads and global event loop are good ideas. There was a lot of prior art on this. So that is what Rust had in 2014.</p>
<p>But: It didn’t fit well with the direction the language was being developed in.</p>
<p>So despite not having an alternative ready, green threads were removed.</p>
<p>This is why now we’re seeing futures and async/await being implemented in totally different styles, based on state machines and generators.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the easy way, but it was the one that gives Rust much of the flexibility it has today.</p>
