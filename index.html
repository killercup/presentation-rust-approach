<p>I’ve been working with Rust since early 2014, and I’ve been loving every minute of it.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m leading the CLI working group. Our goal is to make writing command line applications in Rust <em>amazing</em>!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Woah, that’s a completely different spin on it.</p>
<p>What did Graydon mean by it?</p>
<p>By the way, he goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many older languages <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">are</annotation></semantics></math> better than new ones. We keep forgetting already-learned lessons.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>This talk is on how the Rust community embraces the idea of looking at “prior art”.</p>
<p>If you don’t know this phrase, here is how Wikipedia defines it. As you can see it’s originally from patent laws.</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-need-to-re-invent-everything">We don’t need to re-invent everything</h2>
<p>We should embrace the ideas that are already out there, and apply them in the current context.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Some people I know have this tendency to try to work through problem all on their own. They sit down, think real hard, and come up with a solution. That is a good idea when it comes to very domain-specific problems but more general concepts it really pays off to look at what is already out there.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-not-a-rewrite-it-in-rust-talk">This is not a “Rewrite it in Rust” talk</h2>
<div class="fragment">
<p>It’s more of a “be curious and try out weird things” kind of talk</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>But I don’t mean this in the sense of: Look at an existing piece of software and rewrite it in Rust, just because you think it being Rust makes it better.</p>
<p>We should always make sure to adapt to the current context. What have we learned in the meantime? What were the original designers not happy with?</p>

<h1>For example: The borrow checker</h1>
<p>Problem: Write memory-safe high-performance code</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I’ll talk about some projects, as well as some people, and their stories. The first one is about the borrow checker. Or, the Ownership and Borrowing system that is arguably the main features that differentiates Rust from other mainstream languages.</p>
<p>The problem was writing memory-safe high-performance code. C/C++ allow writing high-performance code but getting it right is very hard.</p>
<p>Rust is a try at making a language that allowed both: High performance, and memory safety.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS_(programming_language)">ATS</a> (2005): ML-inspired language with a built-in theorem prover</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I specifically said “mainstream languages”: Because there are other languages that tried that before!</p>
<p>At AT&amp;T Labs, the Cyclone language was developed as a “safe C” dialect. If you look at its features you’ll see a bunch of similarities with Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>pointer types that are guaranteed to be not-NULL</li>
<li>pointers must be initialized before they can be used</li>
<li>only safe casts</li>
</ul>
<p>Another language is ATS (Applied Type System). It’s inspired by ML, and its main feature is the built-in theorem prover. Using this, it can, at compile-time, prove the absence of buffer overflows and memory corruptions, but also other properties like division by zero.</p>
